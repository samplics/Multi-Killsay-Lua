# Multi-Killsay-Lua

### **What is the multi killsay lua?**
With the multi killsay lua, you are able to set an infinite amount of killsay messages, and say a different one for each kill that you get!
You can set the messages so be spoken in descending order as they were entered, or to be chosen at random.

All messages are entered into a settings.ini file which will be located in CSGO\FilesForLUA\sampli\Multi Killsay
